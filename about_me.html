									<h1>About Me</h1>
                
								</header>
								
								<p>I am a computer engineer graduate from Syracuse University (Class of 2020). I chose to pursue 
                                    Computer Engineering Masters program after finishing my Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering 
                                    as in my senior year I had the opportunity to work with drones; a perfect combination of software 
                                    and hardware for me.
                                    <br/>
                                    Being from an electronic discipline and working on an autonomous drone for wildfire detection, 
                                    I realized how much I lack in programming knowledge. It was then I decided to put extra hours 
                                    outside my academics to learn programming. I drove a 3 man team in giving shape to the project 
                                    from conception to the final product.
                                    <br/>
                                    With all the excitement to learn and explore software discipline, I studied advanced computer 
                                    architecture, object-oriented design, advanced algorithms, and data structures with database 
                                    management and internet programming during my master's program. 
                                    <br/>
                                    I was hired at Syracuse Center of Excellence and was assigned to work on an IoT project. I 
                                    had to integrate multiple sensors and develop an application to control the device with the 
                                    ability of data acquisition. During the summer, I not only learned new tech stack I had to work
                                     on, but delivered an efficient and robust functioning prototype.
                                    <br/>
                                    Outside all technical endeavors, I honed my communication and public speaking skills while hosting 
                                    multiple tech-talks and events in my undergraduate college as head of the entrepreneurship cell. 
                                    Additionally, I maintained my mother's business website and youtube channel to help her brand, 
                                    Saksham, grow online. Today she is India's top digital leader in her company.
